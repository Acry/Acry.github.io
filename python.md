[Action Tags](action_tags.html) is done in Python 3 and GTK.

I finished most of the Demos, now I am in the progress of cleaning and pushing. During that progress, I will focus on the more unusual use-cases. There are plenty sites offering basic tutorials. I am aiming at closing the gap between Python and C Code and offering advanced stuff.

## Python

In June 2019 Python has reached again an all time high in TIOBE index of 8.5% popularity growth.

### PyGObject Demos

PyGObject has some potential.

Checkout the [Demo Suite](https://github.com/Acry/PyGObject-GTK).

### PyGTK Demos

[Python 2's end of life has been announced](https://pythonclock.org/), so it may not be a good idea to get started. Since I worked for somebody else on existing Python 2 Code, I had to dig into PyGtk.

Checkout the [Demo Suite](https://github.com/Acry/PyGTK).

Note:<br>
Most of the older Demos are [here](https://github.com/Acry/CT-Z-Sandbox/tree/master/PyGtk). But it is a mess! Lists don't scale. I don't want to read phonebooks, like the most API-Crawlers offer; even empowered by a search-function, most API-Helper are either Lists, Trees or simply cross-references. Those have been kind of helpful in the past and since the files are often stored in xml/json/html the good old grep fails. I really think it is about time to develop a real developer help. IDE's showed some progress in the past, especially for OO-Languages

### What I think about Python

<br>
and is `True` for Ruby and some other languages as well.<br>
<br>
If a Programming Language has a Version Number it basically lost its status of being a Language. It is more like an API, to the C language in many cases.<br>

Don't get me wrong, both languages proved that they deserve their own space in Software Development, they are great for prototyping, especially if one has an OOP background - but, if a software is getting mature and proves that it is useful, one should switch to a real language. I have got my own thoughts about OOP per se, it was introduced as as doctrine in formal Computer Science Education worldwide and it turned out it wasn't the Chim√§ra we have been looking for.

OOP brought a lot functionality, which brings complexity with it. ... TBC
