[Action Tags](action_tags.html) is done in Python 3 and GTK.

I finished most of the Demos, now I am in progress of cleaning and pushing.

### PyGObject Demos

PyGObject has some potential.

Checkout the [Demo Suite](https://github.com/Acry/PyGObject-GTK).

### PyGTK Demos

[Python 2's End of life has been announced](https://pythonclock.org/), so it may not be a good idea to get started. Since I worked for somebody else on existing Python 2 Code, I had to dig into PyGtk.

### What I think about Python
<br>
and is `True` for Ruby and some other languages as well.<br>
<br>
If a Programming Language has a Version Number it basically lost its status of being a Language. It is more like an API, to the C language in many cases.<br>

Don't get me wrong, both languages proved that they deserve their own space in Software Development, they are great for prototyping, especially if one has an OOP background - but, if a software is getting mature and proves that it is useful, one should switch to a real language. I have got my own thoughts about OOP per se, it was introduced as as doctrine in formal Computer Science Education worldwide and it turns out it wasn't the Chim√§ra we have been looking for.

OOP brought a lot functionality, which brings complexity with it.
