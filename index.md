## SDL2 C Examples, Tutorials, Demos and more
Not covering Setup here, if you struggle to get things up and running, refer to one of those pages:
[Will Usher](https://www.willusher.io/sdl2%20tutorials/2013/08/15/lesson-0-setting-up-sdl) or
[Lazy Foo](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php).  

#### Mac OS
[Setting Up An SDL2 Project In Xcode 9](http://matthewstyles.com/set-up-an-sdl2-project-in-xcode/) or [without Xcode](https://medium.com/@edkins.sarah/set-up-sdl2-on-your-mac-without-xcode-6b0c33b723f7).  
#### Using SDL2 with CMake
[Trenki's Dev Blog](https://trenki2.github.io/blog/2017/06/02/using-sdl2-with-cmake/)  

Everything else and more will be covered here, tho this is pure C and mainly Linux orientated, what doesn't mean I don't cross-compile for Windows or Android. If you need a german translation I could make that happen.

As soon as the size here is getting out of hand, I will jump to a wiki page and merge repos. If you want to host a website with tutorials [contact me](https://discourse.libsdl.org/u/Acry/).
