title: Finding the proper C IDE

After letting my contract run out I picked up my old projects. In the past years I could only write occasionally in C and gave VSCode a shot. [You can checkout the repo](https://github.com/Acry/C-Starter-VSCode)

Honestly it's a pain in the a$$ to find a proper C IDE. If you look at resharper and rider one can really get jealous at modern IDE's.

However, after fiddling with KDevelop and VSCode I decided to use CLion. But be warned, it's written in Java and it needs massive resources. Yes I have a subscription (All Products Pack).
I won't even run properly on an MacBook Air M1.

[Here is a quick video comparing CLion & VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRPdh20kyEc)
